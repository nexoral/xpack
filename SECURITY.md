# Security Policy

xpack maintains a responsible disclosure process. If you discover a security
issue, please report it privately so we can fix it before public disclosure.

How to report
-------------

Send an email to ankansahaofficial@gmail.com including:

1. A description of the issue
2. Steps to reproduce (or a test case)
3. The xpack version (see `VERSION`) and environment details
4. Any suggested mitigation, if available

Do not open a public GitHub issue for an unreported vulnerability.

Response timeline
-----------------

- Acknowledgement within ~48 hours
- Triage and validation
- Fix scheduled and released; coordinated disclosure if appropriate

Security best practices for packagers
-----------------------------------

- Verify and test binaries before packaging
- Review included scripts and service files before installing packages
- Use signed artifacts and cryptographic verification where possible

Thank you for helping keep xpack users safe.
